**New for 2026: Image now published from ghcr.io**  

Enterprises using CircleCI will find that building executors is a common task. Having a dedicated resource, pre-configured and maintained with image testing frameworks, security scanning, and provenance tools will make for a consistent, quality experience.  

>**Note:** This image was previously published to Dockerhub as twdps/circleci-executor-builder. Beginning in February 2026, image is now released from ghcr.io/twplatformlabs/circleci-executor-builder.  

The PSK builder includes common tools:  

**configuration testing**  
- [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core)
- [hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint)

**scanning**  
- [scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/quickstart/)
- [snyk](https://github.com/snyk/cli)
- [trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)
- [grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype)

**provenance**
- [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)
- [syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft)
- [oras](https://github.com/oras-project/oras)

_Review the build and CVE scan logs in the release assets for specific packages versions and known vulnerabilities (if any)._

**signature**. Images are signed using `cosign`. Verify images using the twplatformlabs [public key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twplatformlabs/static/master/cosign.pub).  
```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub twdps/circleci-executor-builder:alpine-2025.04
```  
**provenance and bill of materials**. For each published image, a _provenance_ and _Software Bill of Materials_ is generated by buildx and added as an attestation. Use common tools for inspection.  

Or, use the [from-manifest.sh](https://github.com/twplatformlabs/circleci-remote-docker/blob/main/from-manifest.sh) script to print json versions of either to stdout.  

### Tagging Scheme

This image has the following tagging scheme:

```
ghcr.io/twplatformlabs/circleci-executor-builder:[alpine | ubuntu]-<YYYY.MM>
ghcr.io/twplatformlabs/circleci-executor-builder::[alpine | ubuntu]-latest
ghcr.io/twplatformlabs/circleci-executor-builder:[alpine | ubuntu]-dev.SHA:0:7
```

`-<YYYY.MM>` - Release version of the image, referred to by the 4 digit year, dot, and a 2 digit month. For example `2025.04` would be the monthly tag from April 2025. This image is generated monthly, based on the then current release of the base image and related packages and provides a predictable fixed point for use in an executor Dockerfile. Review the build log in the pipeline artifacts for the specific image and package versions. Occasionally there will be interim patches released and you may see `2025.04.1` or addtional numbered versions.  

`-latest` - generic tag that always points to the latest, monthly release image. Typically used by other recurring builds and not recommended for pipeline usage. Pin pipelines to specific month-tagged builds.  

`-dev.SHA:0:7` - is the latest development of the Base image. Built from the `HEAD` of the `main` branch. Intended to be used as a testing version of the image with the most recent changes.
